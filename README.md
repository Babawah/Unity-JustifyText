# Unity-JustifyText
Override UnityUI Text class to add a justify option

## Installation

Import TextJustified.cs and Editor/TextJustifiedEditor.cs in your project.

## Usage

Simply add TextJustified.cs on your UI object instead of the Text component.
Use it the same way as the UnityUI Text component, only a checkbox for justification is added.


## WARNING

It's kind of a quick fix. I did not test it extensively and is totally not optimized.
I recommend testing before using it in a serious project.
